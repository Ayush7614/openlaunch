# Launch runbook — basebid.lol launchpad

> **Working copy:** this repo (`gitlawb-platform/openlaunch`) is the single source since 2026-09-07. Deploy from
> `app/` with the command below; the old `basebid` deploy tree is archived. Local-only files that never enter git:
> `app/.env.local`, `app/.env.development.local`, `app/.env.production`, `contracts/.env`, `contracts/.launchpad-deployer.address`.


## 0. Deploy the contracts (Base mainnet)
Deployer key lives in the macOS keychain (service `basebid-launchpad-deployer`); address in
`../contracts/.launchpad-deployer.address`. Fund it with ~0.001 ETH on Base (deploy ≈ 0.00006 ETH).
```
cd ../contracts
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=$(security find-generic-password -s basebid-launchpad-deployer -w) \
  forge script script/DeployLaunchFactory.s.sol --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org --broadcast
# → LaunchFactory + LaunchLocker addresses + the deploy block (broadcast/…/run-latest.json)
forge verify-contract <factory> src/LaunchFactory.sol:LaunchFactory --chain base \
  --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "c(address,address,address)" 0x498581fF718922c3f8e6A244956aF099B2652b2b 0x7C5f5A4bBd8fD63184577525326123B519429bDc 0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3)

```

## 1. Wind down the old board (owner = the BaseBid deployer EOA)
The old escrow (`0x7a6373BC4796971059824D5ce8DF71AdE54d0285`) still holds bidders' USDC and the
withdraw UI is gone. Push every refund from the owner key, then nothing else is needed:
```
cast send 0x7a6373BC4796971059824D5ce8DF71AdE54d0285 "endSeasonEarly()" --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org --private-key $OWNER
cast send 0x7a6373BC4796971059824D5ce8DF71AdE54d0285 "batchRelease(uint256,uint256)" 1 100 --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org --private-key $OWNER
# check: cast call … "totalLocked()(uint256)" → 0
```
(function names per `../contracts/src/BaseBid.sol`; see `../contracts/docs/BASEBID.md`.)

## 2. Fly
```
cd basebid
NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_FACTORY=0x… NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_LOCKER=0x… LAUNCH_DEPLOY_BLOCK=… ./scripts/fly-secrets.sh
fly deploy -c fly.toml --ha=false --remote-only \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_FACTORY=0x… --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_LOCKER=0x…
curl -s https://basebid.lol/api/health
```
The release command applies `db/schema.sql` (adds the launch tables; leaves the old `bb_*`
board tables in place — drop them by hand later if wanted).

## 3. Smoke
Run `scripts/smoke.sh` after EVERY deploy (all page types + live APIs must be 200). Then:
Launch one token from the site with a real wallet (0% fee), buy 0.001 ETH of it, sell half,
press Collect on a 1% launch. Check `/api/launch/feed` shows all of it.

## Token logo uploads (Tigris bucket)

Logos are uploaded through `POST /api/launch/image` (wallet + per-IP rate limits, magic-byte sniff, sharp
re-encode to a 512² WebP with metadata stripped, random key) into a PUBLIC Tigris bucket. The app only
ever PUTs; nothing is deletable through the site. Create the bucket once (stages the AWS_* + BUCKET_NAME
secrets on the app automatically):

```
fly storage create -a basebid -n openlaunch-images --public
```

Then `fly deploy`. Public URL base defaults to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.fly.storage.tigris.dev`
(override with `IMAGE_PUBLIC_BASE`). Without the bucket the route answers 503 and the form falls back to
the paste-a-URL field. Local dev: `IMAGE_STORE=local` → `.uploads/` served by `/api/launch/image/<key>`.
The per-token share card embeds a logo ONLY when it lives on that bucket host (`isOwnImageUrl`).

## Database backups (Fly built-in, enabled 2026-09-07)

Two layers, both automatic:

1. **Volume snapshots** — Fly snapshots the `basebid-db` volume daily; retention raised to 30 days
   (`fly volumes update <vol> -a basebid-db --snapshot-retention 30`). Restore = new volume from the
   snapshot → new Postgres machine. Day granularity.
2. **Postgres backups to Tigris** (`fly pg backup enable -a basebid-db`, then `fly secrets deploy -a basebid-db`
   to apply — that restarts the single Postgres machine, ~2 min of DB downtime): WAL archived every 60s,
   full base backup every 24h, 7-day point-in-time recovery window, bucket `basebid-db-postgres` (private,
   managed by Fly). Check: `fly pg backup list -a basebid-db` · `fly pg backup config show -a basebid-db`.

**Restore rehearsal (passed 2026-09-07 01:00Z):** `fly pg backup restore basebid-db-restore-test -a basebid-db
--restore-target-name <ID>` built a fresh cluster in ~100s; row counts matched production up to the backup's
end time (333 launches / 7,794 swaps / 522 metadata rows / 8 posts / 237 fee events). Query a restored
cluster with `fly ssh console -a <app> -C "sh -c 'PGPASSWORD=\$OPERATOR_PASSWORD psql -h localhost -p 5433
-U postgres -d basebid -c ...'"` (port 5433, not the socket). Destroy the rehearsal app afterwards.
For a real recovery: restore to a new app, `fly postgres detach`/`attach` it to `basebid` (DATABASE_URL),
redeploy, run `scripts/smoke.sh`. Point-in-time: `--restore-target-time <RFC3339>` instead of a name.
